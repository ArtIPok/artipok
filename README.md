# Hello there! üëã

## ü§µ About Me:

I'm an ambitious and responsible UI designer with a penchant for tackling challenges head-on. My innate drive ensures that I always strive to find a solution to every problem. For years, I served as an academic lecturer, equipping me not just with a thirst for knowledge but also an aptitude to impart that knowledge to others. Throughout my entire career, I've been deeply rooted in the IT realm. Leading numerous projects related to information systems has provided me with profound expertise in system analysis from a business perspective, system administration, and laying the groundwork for new functionalities.

In my free time, I love to indulge in reading, particularly gravitating towards fantasy novels and thrillers. I'm also quite active, always eager to embark on a new adventure or challenge.

## üíº Professional Strengths:

- **UI Design Expertise:** Crafting visually appealing and user-centric web designs.
- **Deep Backend Knowledge:** Proficient in the JAVA language, ensuring a cohesive frontend-backend integration.
- **Database Mastery:** Extensive experience with relational databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, Microsoft SQL, and Firebird.
